/*Write a program in which user enters his NTS and F.Sc marks and your
program will help student in selection of university. Based on these marks
Student will be allocated a seat at different department of different university.
a. Oxford University:
i. IT: Above 70% in Fsc. And 70 % in NTS
ii. Electronics: Above 70% in Fsc. And 60 % in NTS
iii. Telecomunication: Above 70% in Fsc. And 50 % in NTS
b. MIT:
i. IT: 70% - 60 % in Fsc. And 50 % in NTS
ii. Chemical: 59% â€“ 50 % in Fsc. And 50 % in NTS
iii. Computer: Above 40% and below 50 % in Fsc. And 50 % in NTS*/
